# work-day-schedule
For this project, I was asked to make a work schedule that would turn a specific color given the time. Users are supposed to add what they want to do for the day, and the color would change depending on the time, if it equals the current time it would turn red, meaning its due, if it's yellow it means it's past the time expected, and if it is green then they still have time to complete the assignment. Given that, I was also asked to connect that user input to the local storage, so that whenever I clicked on the saved button, the user input would be sent to the local storage, and then copied back over when the page was reset.
